Due to certain circumstances, he formed a \"fake\" couple with his childhood friend Kurumi Isoshima, but otherwise, he lives a normal life. However, one day, he comes across a girl named Mui Aiba, in a uniform he has never seen before, collapsed on the school campus. This encounter changes Takeshi's destiny completely.

In the past, the black-and-silver winged Bahamut has threatened to destroy the land, but humans, gods, and demons overcame their differences to fight together and seal its power.

Now, two thousand years later, the world is in an era of peace—until the day a human woman steals the gods' half of the key.",
